<h3>Avengers Movies Specifically "Infinity War"</h3>
<p>Great action and sci-fi movie with amazing fighting scenes, especially the scene where all the Avengers assemble and join the fight against Thanos. </p>

<p>I love this movie, it brings me back to my days in high school and it makes me reminisce on the good times of my younger self.</p>
<h3>This is where I leave you</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favorite dramas. It's about a family of six that lost their dad, and they all come back home to mourn him and reconnect. A really cool movie.</p>
